My html project.
This is the first project for practicing my html. It will be a basic recipe website. By the end of this project I should have the skills to:
- make a new repo on github
- clone it to my local PC
- make a basic functioning website using html
- use git add + git commit throughout the project
- add good messages to commits
- use git push origin main
